BLAMming numbers
Ramgo, the BLAMming gun toting action hero, is out to destroy the evil armies of Absurdistan before they can attack America! However, he is too dumb to provide a steady supply of BLAMming Numbers. He's counting on you to calculate these for him, instead, so he can save America and take all the glory.

These BLAMming Numbers are very special numbers used to create ammo for the BLAMming gun. You can calculate them as follows:

Take all the prime factors of a number. If none of these factors are larger than N, the number is an N mm BLAMming Number.

The input will be two numbers, seperated by a space. The first gives the size of the BLAMming Numbers wanted, the second gives the amount of BLAMming Numbers.
The output is a space separated list of BLAMming Numbers, until the amount specified is reached.
