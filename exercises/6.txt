Supernova
The sun is about to go supernova! The evil mastermind Dr. Pulsar is sending gamma waves straight into the sun, causing it to swell and swell...

Luckily, we have implanted a control chip in his cat, who he always strokes while it sits in his lap. If it hears a specific number, it will activate, scratching Dr. Pulsar's face who will then (conveniently) accidentally hit the base's self-destruct button.

There is no possible way this will go wrong.

We are looking for the number of distinct factors of the product of these numbers.

So for example:

'3 5 7' should result in '8'
'2 4 6' should result in '10'
'5 5' should result in '3'

Each element in the input sequence is smaller than 1000000.
