Zombies
The town has been overrun by a zombie horde! After three weeks, a cure was found that will also conveniently restore everyone to perfect health! The cure is a healthy injection of some not-so-complicated molecule. However most of our computer people around fell victim to the horde pretty quickly (being the nerds in a horror story) so our scientists need your help to quickly compute elements needed for the molecule.

The input will be the chemical formula for our cure molecule in one line. You should then output the number of elements for each element in this molecule. 

Example:

Input:
C4H8(ONa)2

Output:
C: 4
H: 8
Na: 2
O: 2

Note: Remember that an element name can consist of a capital letter (H) or the combination of a capital and a small letter (Na). Also remember that more complex molecules will have brackets, also possibly multiplied by a number.
