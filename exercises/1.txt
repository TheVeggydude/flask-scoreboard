When thinking of binary sequences,how many n-digit binary numbers will not have two 1 bits next to each other?
for example we give the binary numbers for n=3:


000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111

Here five of the eight possibilities meet the criteria, so the answer for n=3 would be 5. what is the answer for n= 4, 2 , 6, 100.
