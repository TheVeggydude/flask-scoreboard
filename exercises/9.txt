Mergin'
We define jfdsklafldfjklasdjl as follows:
We take string A. We define reverse(A) as the reverse of A (yes really). We define shuffle(A) as any random ordering of the characters in A. merge(B, C) is the merging of B and C with the only contraint being that the order of the characters in both string is kept.

We define I as merge(reverse(A), shuffle(A)). For a given input I, recover the A with the smallest lexicographic ordering (so if you can choose between ba and ab, choose ab)

Input:
baabbb

Output:
bab

Explanation:
Split as follows:
b ab
 a  bb
Reverse the former to obtain bab
Shuffle the other to obtain bab

Input:
bananaananab

Output:
aaannb

Explanation:
Split as follows:
bananaananab
b n naa   a
 a a   nan b
Reverse the former to obtain aaannb
Shuffle the other to obtain aaannb
