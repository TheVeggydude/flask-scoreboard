INSERT TITLE
//Bab, think of something that's somehow even stupider than the rest.
//Also, it has to include <><><><>, which is calculated by:

Given an array of size N, you have to print the size of the largest contiguous subarray such that the least common multiple of all integers in that subarray is equal to the product of all integers in that subarray. A single element is not considered a subarray.

Should no such subarray exist, output -1.

So, for example '2 2 3 4' should output '2'
